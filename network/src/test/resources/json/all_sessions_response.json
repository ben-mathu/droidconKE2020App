And since then a bunch of new libraries like Koin or Kodein appeared. Developers are even writing articles how to do DI without any framework.\r\nSome argue that those don’t even offer real dependency injection. Let’s look at that argument and compare the approaches.\r\nSo, is there something wrong with Dagger & co. in Kotlin? Are they obsolete? What are the alternatives? Let’s dive in.",
